Here are some commonly asked interview coding questions based on the CSS topics you provided for candidates with around 2 years of experience:

**For CSS Strong Candidates:**

1. **Flexbox and Grid Layouts:**
   Implement a responsive layout using CSS Grid or Flexbox, showcasing knowledge of grid columns/rows, alignment, and responsiveness.

2. **Animations, Transitions, and Transformations:**
   Create CSS animations/transitions for hover effects, page load animations, or element transformations (e.g., rotate, scale).

3. **Advanced Bootstrap Usage:**

**For CSS Capable Candidates:**

1. **@import, @media, @font-face:**
   Demonstrate the use of @import for importing external stylesheets, @media queries for responsive design breakpoints, and @font-face for custom font loading.

2. **Responsive Design and Mobile-First Approach:**
   Create a responsive webpage layout using media queries targeting different screen sizes. Discuss the importance of mobile-first design principles.

3. **Best Practices and Methodologies:**
   Implement CSS using ITCSS (Inverted Triangle CSS), BEM (Block Element Modifier), or similar methodologies for scalable and maintainable CSS code. Use SASS or LESS for enhanced styling capabilities and code organization.

4. **Bootstrap Basics:**
   Utilize Bootstrap grid system, components (e.g., navbar, cards, forms), and utilities (e.g., spacing classes, text alignment) to build responsive and styled web components.
